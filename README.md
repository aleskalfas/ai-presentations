# AI Presentations Repository

This repository serves as a personal archive of presentations I've created on various AI topics throughout my professional journey. It helps me track my progression and evolution of thought in the AI field. Each deck represents my work and research at different points in time, documenting my exploration of artificial intelligence concepts and applications. Below you'll find links to each presentation along with the dates I worked on them and brief descriptions.
